# ProToolkitLExtrusion

My approach is OOP for the C API of Pro/Toolkit. 
In companies I learned to code in an OOP fashion and left C programming only if I have no other choise.

In order for the example to work for you plese:
Please update the protk.dat according to the path you will put the project.
Please set the environmental variables for the pro/toolkit according to your Paths in order your system to find the libraries and includes of 
Pro/Toolkit.
