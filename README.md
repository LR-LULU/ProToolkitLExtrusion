# ProToolkitLExtrusion

My approach is OOP for the C API of Pro/Toolkit. 
In companies I learned to code in an OOP fashion and left C programming only if I have no other choise.

In order for the example to work for you plese:

Please update the protk.dat according to the path you will put the project.

Please set the environmental variables for the pro/toolkit according to your Paths in order your system to find the libraries and includes of 
Pro/Toolkit.

Please set the build type as x64 Release in your visual studio 2017 and newer. It is configured just for this type.

Please start a Part session before starting the Application as it hooks to the current model. You can change this behavior if you want to by altering the code.
